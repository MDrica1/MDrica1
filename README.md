### Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I recently graduated in Astrophysics, where I used computing in some disciplines and to complete my Final Paper, and now I'm looking to learn more about this universe and start a career transition. I've been taking courses and I've already collaborated on a mobile app development project.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more projects to expand my knowledge in computing and start my new career project.
